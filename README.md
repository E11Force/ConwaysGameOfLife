Basic cell automat "Conway's game of life"
Implementation of cell automat "Conway's game of life" invented by John Horton Conway in 1970.
Game of life is one of the examples of system emergent properties. Once the initial state is set
all cells will act according to preset rules. This behaviour can produce various 'configurations'
that will have different behaviours, such as moving in particular direction, producing other 'configurations'
or deleting certain 'configurations'.
